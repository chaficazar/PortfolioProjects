# Project 3: Data Cleaning

- In this project, I've used SQL to perform Data cleaning on a publicly available dataset (raw excel file included in this folder)
- Data cleaning is a crucial step that prepares the data for further analysis
- Normalized all fields by ensuring that each column contains only one set of information
- Deleted duplicates
- Standardized date formats
- Detected and updated anomalies in the data (Query 4)
- Deleted unused columns in the end
