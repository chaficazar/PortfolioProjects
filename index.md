- In this project, I've used publicly available data to visualize and analyze the evolution of the energy mix since 1965
- Performed minor data cleaning to prepare the dataset for further harmonious calculations
- Identified shortcomings in used dataset
- Monitored the gradual penetration of renewable energy into the energy mix and identified regions & countries with the highest resistance to renewable energy adoption
