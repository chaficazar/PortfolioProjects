- In this project, I've used publicly available data to visualize and analyze the evolution of the energy mix since 1965
- Performed minor data cleaning to prepare the dataset for further harmonious calculations
- Identified shortcomings in used dataset

- In this project, I've used SQL to analyze publicly available data pertaining to coronavirus statistics globally. I then used Tableau to visualize the results of certain queries 
- All data as of 1st of April 2022
- Identified shortcomings in used dataset
- Hospitalization data and number of logged tests effectuated was not accurate and consistent across the dataset to allow a more detailed analysis of percentage of hospitalizations and percentage of positive tests
- SQL queries offered insight into interesting parameters, including the dates of vaccine rollout in each country, percentage of vaccinated people in each country and their corresponding poverty indices, percentage of vaccinated population who opted for the booster shot in each country, in addition to a dynamic table showing infection rates, death rates, and vaccination rates by day, both per country and globally
