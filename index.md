- In this project, I've used SQL to analyze publicly available data pertaining to coronavirus statistics globally. I then used Tableau to visualize the results of certain queries 
- All data as of 1st of April 2022
- Identified shortcomings in used dataset
- Hospitalization data and number of logged tests effectuated was not accurate and consistent across the dataset to allow a more detailed analysis of percentage of hospitalizations and percentage of positive tests
- SQL queries offered insight into interesting parameters, including the dates of vaccine rollout in each country, percentage of vaccinated people in each country and their corresponding poverty indices, percentage of vaccinated population who opted for the booster shot in each country, in addition to a dynamic table showing infection rates, death rates, and vaccination rates by day, both per country and globally

# Project 3: Data Cleaning

*[SQL Code](https://github.com/chaficazar/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Project%203/SQLCode.sql)*

- In this project, I've used SQL to perform Data cleaning on a publicly available dataset (raw excel file accessible [here](https://github.com/chaficazar/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Project%203/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx))
- Data cleaning is a crucial step that prepares the data for further analysis
- Normalized all fields by ensuring that each column contains only one set of information
- Deleted duplicates
- Standardized date formats
- Detected and updated anomalies in the data (Query 4)
- Deleted unused columns in the end

- The purpose of this exercise is twofold: (i) Analyze the evolution of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Region projects market over the past 10 years using a projects database, and (ii) outline projects in the pipeline in Kuwait and identify potential partners to jointly pursue upcoming projects. All data used for this exercise can be accessed [here](https://github.com/chaficazar/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/Project%204/Initial%20Data)
- At an initial stage, data cleaning was performed to prepare the data for further analysis
- Monitored the evolution of the GCC market by country since 2012 in terms of industry, sector and subsector development, in addition to project count, project values, biggest clients and biggest contractors
- The State of Kuwait was emphasized in this exercise since it is the market of interest for my current company
- Identified upcoming projects in Kuwait and used the Roles table to filter contractors and shortlist potential partners based on 3 criteria, in order to jointly bid for such projects.
